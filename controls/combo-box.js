// Could accept only some specific types of data eg numeric.
//  May well want nicer / custom scrollbars.

// It will be a text box but the selection list appears below.
//  So we will use List with its own scrollbar.

// Should be made out of component JSGUI controls as necessary. both option control as well as text box.

// text-input
//  drop-down-list (menu)

class Combo_Box extends Control {
    constructor(spec) {
        super(spec);

        // Has various items.
        // At the top is a control that either shows the item selected, or search text.


        //  
        //  Could use Items_Container mixin.
        //  Open_Closed mixin

        // Run-time mixins for the moment.



        // Maybe contain a single main area and a drop-down box

    }
