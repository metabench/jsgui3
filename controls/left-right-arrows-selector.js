/*
    Encapsulates an array with a range of possible values.
    // Maybe a number of years.

    // Basically just chooses an index within the array, and can get a value for the item in the array too.

    // Could be used for picking a year, or months within a year.

    // Events responding to the UI events and changes there.
    //  Does its internal processing, raises external event when event occurs.

    // Tile_Slide_Panel could be useful here, and with Month_View
    //  With Month_View, would have entire month views rendered already for previous and next months.

    // Possibility of Tile_Slide_Panel being something that would hack into another control?

    // Want it so that a control can be wrapped automatically in a Title_Slide_Panel, so adjacent controls also get constructed.

    // Still want the Month_View to be fairly simple.
    //  Month_View is a place where its worth implementing Tile_Slide or Tile_Slide_Panel.
